# Overview #
This is some short code that can be used to simulate an *MM1* queue (a queue with Markovian inter-arrival and service rates and 1 server). The code is used in a short video [Simulating a Queue](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEA8m3j-Jqk) describing a basic approach to simulating a queue.

If people would like to mess around with this code please do!

If people are interested in discrete event simulation within python I know that a library called [SimPy](http://simpy.sourceforge.net/) (unfortunate name re SymPy) exists but I've never used it.
